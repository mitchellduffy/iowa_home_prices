The goal of this project was to understand the basics of current methods for working with tabular data.

I was interested in learning about how to train models and to discover, through experience, how a pipeline can be created.

I have been following along with the Learn Machine Learning course by DanB on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/learn-machine-learning
